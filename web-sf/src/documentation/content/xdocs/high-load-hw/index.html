    <title>curl-loader - High Load HW</title> 
  </header>
  <body> 
      <p>We have used the following HW to run loads of 60K clients/users:</p>
<br/>
an old PC with dual Xeon and 2-4 GB of checked memory, where 4GB is recommended.
We compiled curl-loader with optimization, tuned linux as described in our FAQs (see
HOWTOS-FAQs and run the loader with threads using command line option -t 2 or -t 4.
Please, note that due to still unresolved bugs most probably in libevent, the loader may crash
on start. Workaround it by re-running and/or, optionally, changing the number of threads.
We are recommending to run the number of threads close to the number of logical CPUs.<br/>
<br/>
<p>To run a load of 100-150 K clients/users we would suggest to use:</p>
<br/>
a PC-box equipped with two modern dual core Intel or AMD CPUs and 8GB of checked RAM.<br/>
Please, make all optimizations as in HOWTOS-FAQs, mind the total bandwidth limitations of
the box NICs and run it with -t 4 command-line option. Y may wish to limit maximum bandwidth
used by client as specified in HOWTOS-FAQs, using a special URL-section tag.<br/>
<br/>
Many testing scenarious with 100K clients do not require strong processing power and
PC with less CPU resources could be enough. Each client requires about 30-40K of memory +
better to leave some more spare memory for the system, therefore compromises on memory
are not recommended.
