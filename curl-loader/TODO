1. Menu interface to configure testing conf-file. Dialog-like interface
may be a good option. There are several requests for that, particularly
from QA/validation people.

2. Enhancement of statistics for loading/testing:

SIPP provides a useful console output with the loading scenario presentation
and updatable "running counters". Worth using this approach to present
load scenario and major statistics counters. Detailed info about errors may 
be presented in browsable html format.

We should support options to make:
- no statistics;
- minimal set of statistics, TBD;
- all statistics;

Question 1: whether to count SSL handshake time for HTTPS;
Question 2: resolving time;

3. Configuration/making improvements starting from moving all source-files
to src directory etc.
Making to perform unified build for all major libraries, like libcurl, libcares.
 
make <option> to support as options:

debug=1, 0, default is 0 - no debugging symbols;
opt=1, 0, default is 1 - build with optimization;
profile=1,0, default is 0 - build without profiling -pg option
resolver=no, global, cares, default is no. If "global" 
(global DNS cache) enabled, prevent usage with -t (threads) option.

4. Support for CAPS (calls per second) defined mode. Currently, we
are supporting only a certain number of virtual clients and CAPS is the derived
parameter. CAPS-MODE should support a certain number of CAPS, 
and virtual clients number to be the derived parameter. 

5. When login failed due to server-error, we should not proceeed with UAS
and logoff, instead re-attempt the login. This is the behavior of the 
smooth mode on libcurl error, and should be extended to 5xx server 
errors, etc

6. Rewind of the logfile for smooth-mode. It works only for storming mode now.
We can use timer-queue scheduling feature now. Just to add generalization
of timer-event handling.

7. Future releases will hopefully incorporate libcurl HYPER API, using 
curl_multi_socket() approach and epoll support by libevent as in
http://curl.haxx.se/lxr/source/hiper/hipev.c Thus, 50000, 100000 clients
from a single process can become a reality.

8. CAPS (calls per second number) to be managed by the tag 
CAPS_MODE_STEADY_NUM. Thus, number of clients will be a derivative
number, that will vary according to CAPS number achived.

9. Investigate and fix a bug with ftp.
