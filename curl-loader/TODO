1. Future release will hopefully incorporate libcurl HYPER API, using 
curl_multi_socket() approach and epoll support by libevent as in
http://curl.haxx.se/lxr/source/hiper/hipev.c Thus, 50000, 100000 clients
from a single process can become a reality.

2. Good statistics from the smooth mode to be generalized to the 
storming mode as well.

3. Two login modes (GET-POST and POST-only) and 3 logoff modes
(GET-only, GET-POST and POST-only) need to be tested more
both for storming and smooth loading modes.

4. More testing is required for multithreading option.

5. Login authentication and logoff should be separated in the
batch configuration file to some separate modules.

6. Some modularity of configuration file is necessary. XML is a
valid option, but it brings a one more dependency to handle. 
Michael has an idea of a user-interface script, may be linux kernel
like Dialog GUI interface to assist user in configuring configuration
batch files.
