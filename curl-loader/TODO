1. Menu interface to configure testing conf-file. Dialog-like interface
   may be a good option. There are several requests for that, particularly
   from QA/validation people.

2. Good statistics from the smooth mode to be generalized to the 
storming mode as well. We need to provide more statistics, which
not to be limited just to success and error numbers. Requested counters
are redirects numbers, server TCP delay, server SSL-delay (HTTPS only) 
and server application (HTTP) delay per client as well as averages per
batch of clients.

SIPP provides a useful console output with the loading scenario presentation
and updatable "running counters". Worth using this approach to present
load scenario and major statistics counters. Statistics may be also outputted
to an ASCII text file with separators ready for import to Excel. Detailed info
about errors may be presented in browsable html format.

3. Configuration/making improvements starting from moving all source-files
to src directory etc

4. Future releases will hopefully incorporate libcurl HYPER API, using 
curl_multi_socket() approach and epoll support by libevent as in
http://curl.haxx.se/lxr/source/hiper/hipev.c Thus, 50000, 100000 clients
from a single process can become a reality.

5. Advancing to the next libcurl release in order to get libcurl API 
for libcurl hyper mode and integration with libevent for epoll event 
demultiplexing.
