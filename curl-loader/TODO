1. Menu interface to configure testing conf-file. Dialog-like interface
may be a good option. There are several requests for that, particularly
from QA/validation people.

2. Configuration/making improvements starting from moving all source-files
to src directory etc.
Making to perform unified build for all major libraries, like libcurl, libcares.
 
make <option> to support as options:

debug=1, 0, default is 0 - no debugging symbols;
opt=1, 0, default is 1 - build with optimization;
profile=1,0, default is 0 - build without profiling -pg option

3. Support for CAPS (calls per second) defined mode. Currently, we
are supporting only a certain number of virtual clients and CAPS is the derived
parameter. CAPS-MODE should support a certain number of CAPS, 
and virtual clients number to be the derived parameter. 

4. Future releases will hopefully incorporate libcurl HYPER API, using 
curl_multi_socket() approach and epoll support by libevent as in
http://curl.haxx.se/lxr/source/hiper/hipev.c Thus, 50000, 100000 clients
from a single process can become a reality.

5. Support for 401 and 407 authentication responses.
