1. Dialog menu interface to support:
    - multiple UAS urls;

2. Configuration/making improvements: moving all source-files
    to src directory etc.

3. Client certificates per each https, ftps url. Easy to do.

4. Support PUT and POST methods for UAS urls. Does somebody really
    wants it?

5. Support for CAPS (calls per second) defined mode. Currently, we are 
   supporting only a certain number of virtual clients and CAPS is the derived
   parameter. CAPS-MODE MAY support a certain number of CAPS, 
   and virtual clients number to be the derived parameter. 

6. Future releases will hopefully incorporate libcurl HYPER API, using 
   curl_multi_socket() approach and epoll support by libevent as in
   http://curl.haxx.se/lxr/source/hiper/hipev.c Thus, 50000, 100000 clients
   from a single process can become a reality.

7. Testing and better support for FTP and FTPS.
