1. Dialog menu interface to support: multiple UAS urls;

2. Configuration/making improvements: moving all source-files
    to src directory etc.

3. X.509 client certificates per each https, ftps url. Client certificate
    for each client?

4. Support for CAPS (calls per second) defined mode. Currently, we are 
   supporting only a certain number of virtual clients and CAPS is the derived
   parameter. CAPS-MODE MAY support a certain number of CAPS, 
   and virtual clients number to be the derived parameter. 

5. Load Status GUI. Keyboard input as in SIPP to  increase/decrease load 
   (number of loading clients or CAPS).

6. More testing and optimization of the hyper mode. Testbed for 10K, 50K and 100K
    clients.

7. Testing and better support for FTP and FTPS.

8. Support PUT and POST methods for UAS urls. Does somebody really
    wants it?

9. HTTP GET filled forms for login credentials (they are sent using url). 
      Does somebody really wants it?

10. Dynamic allocation of login and logoff post buffers. Current static
       allocation uses too much memory reserves.
