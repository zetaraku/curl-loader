a. To support above 2 tokens (up to 8) in FORM_RECORDS_FILE.
    Tokenize the input in cycle.

b. POST forms improvement and adding more flexebility.
   Support for more flexible API for POST forms:
    http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/curl_formadd.html

c. Support for a single/common IP-address for all clients

d. PUT option support with file transfer and PUT after GET.

e. Add a url-based tag STOP_ON_ERROR not to schedule 
   a client any more on a url error conditions.

f. ERROR_RESPONSE_CODES - add a list or codes considered
   as errors, or not considered as error conditions. By default,
   all HTTP 5xx codes and 4xx -401-407 are considered as errors.
   Something like ERROR_RESPONSE_CODES="+100+101-500-503"

g. ERROR_RESPONSE_BODY - a regular expression pattern for a 
    search in a response body. If not found - error. Look in Apache
   JMeter.

h. Aleksandar Lazic <al-curlloader@none.at> suggested:
to make configurable a number of TCP connections, that our
virtual client can use (the default is up to 5), whether the 
connections are persistant or closed after each request-response 
and, if persistant, what is the number of request-responses
till the connection to be closed and re-established. 

Another proposal of Aleks is to make configurable HTTP 1.1 or 1.0, that
we will not implement unless it becomes a feature required by many
users.

We can add configurable CURLOPT_MAXCONNECTS number
and play with CURLOPT_FRESH_CONNECT/CURLOPT_FORBID_REUSE
options and optionally to enhance them to make configurable number
of request-responses via a tcp-connection till the connection renewal.

httperf sessions - is a reference application.


1. Dialog menu interface to support: multiple UAS urls;

2. Configuration/making improvements: moving all source-files
    to src directory etc.

3. X.509 client certificates per each https, ftps url. Client certificate
    for each client?

4. Support for CAPS (calls per second) defined mode. Currently, we are 
   supporting only a certain number of virtual clients and CAPS is the derived
   parameter. CAPS-MODE MAY support a certain number of CAPS, 
   and virtual clients number to be the derived parameter. 

5. Load Status GUI. Decrease of loading clients number [-|\] - SIPP-like.

6. Testbed for 20K, 50K and 100K clients. We need more powerful HW.

7. Testing and better support for FTP and FTPS.

8. Support PUT and POST methods for UAS urls. Does somebody really
    wants it?

9. HTTP GET filled forms for login credentials (they are sent using url). 
      Does somebody really wants it?

10. Dynamic allocation of login and logoff post buffers. Current static
       allocation uses too much memory reserves.

11. Template-guided output of statistics to statistics file.
