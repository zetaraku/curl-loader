1. Dialog menu interface to support:
    - multiple UAS urls;
    - separate URL parameters to a sub-menu;

2. Configuration/making improvements: moving all source-files
to src directory etc.

3. Support for CAPS (calls per second) defined mode. Currently, we
are supporting only a certain number of virtual clients and CAPS is the derived
parameter. CAPS-MODE should support a certain number of CAPS, 
and virtual clients number to be the derived parameter. 

4. Future releases will hopefully incorporate libcurl HYPER API, using 
curl_multi_socket() approach and epoll support by libevent as in
http://curl.haxx.se/lxr/source/hiper/hipev.c Thus, 50000, 100000 clients
from a single process can become a reality.

5. Support for 401 and 407 authentication responses.
