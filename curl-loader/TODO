1. Menu interface to configure testing conf-file. Dialog-like interface
may be a good option. There are several requests for that, particularly
from QA/validation people.

2. Configuration/making improvements starting from moving all source-files
to src directory etc.
Making to perform unified build for all major libraries, like libcurl, libcares.
 
make <option> to support as options:

debug=1, 0, default is 0 - no debugging symbols;
opt=1, 0, default is 1 - build with optimization;
profile=1,0, default is 0 - build without profiling -pg option


3. Support for CAPS (calls per second) defined mode. Currently, we
are supporting only a certain number of virtual clients and CAPS is the derived
parameter. CAPS-MODE should support a certain number of CAPS, 
and virtual clients number to be the derived parameter. 

4. When login failed due to server-error, we should not proceeed with UAS
and logoff, instead re-attempt the login. This is the behavior of the 
smooth mode on libcurl error, and should be extended to 5xx server 
errors, etc

5. Future releases will hopefully incorporate libcurl HYPER API, using 
curl_multi_socket() approach and epoll support by libevent as in
http://curl.haxx.se/lxr/source/hiper/hipev.c Thus, 50000, 100000 clients
from a single process can become a reality.

6. CAPS (calls per second number) to be managed by the tag 
CAPS_MODE_STEADY_NUM. Thus, number of clients will be a derivative
number, that will vary according to CAPS number achived.
