version 0.18, 12/10/2006

Major improvement of configuration. Several command line options removed and
instread the configuration file enhanced. Configuration file separated to several
sections, namely:
- GENERAL;
- LOGIN;
- UAS (user activity simulation, like fetching URLs and sleeping);
- LOGOFF;
Only GENERAL section is a MUST, whereas other sections are enabled whenever
is necessary, depending on the purpose of the testing. 

Several more options for LOGIN and LOGOFF parts are added.


version 0.17, 10/11/2006

-Added ChangeLog and TODO files.
	
-README - improved to contain information, available before only
 from curl_loader -h

-Authentication using POST has been unfortunately disabled in storming
 mode. Fixed the bug, with thanks to Arik Nahmany, Arik.Nahmany@vocaltec.com,
 for pointing this.

-Some people may be interested to load their servers with multiple logging of
 the same user and with the same password. We have allowed a more
 sophisticated case with user and password incrementing and being unique, but
 no reason not to support this rather simple case. Added support for this,
 where, when POST login string contains two %d, we are incrementing username
 and password, and, if the string lacks any %d symbols, this id the simple
 case. Thanks to Arik Nahmany, Arik.Nahmany@vocaltec.com for suggesting this
 feature and testing it.

-Fixed an old bug of storming mode, where the first url used in
 authentication was also participating in further load. When authentication is
 required, the first url not to be used in load, unless option '-a' is added to to the 
 commandline.

-Added support for cookies, which are set in some cases upon authentication.

-Enabled infinitive number of redirections. 

- Logoff operation enabled as GET-only, GET+POST and POST-only. Initially,
 it was tested for the storming mode. This is managed by the '-w' commandline
 option, whereas '-z' is in charge for tuning login options between GET+POST 
and POST-only.
