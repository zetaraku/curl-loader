            Batch is a group of clients with the same characteristics and 
            loading behavior. We recommend you to use unique names for your 
            batches, because logfiles and statistics files names are derived
            from the batch name + extension.

config CLIENTS_NUM
	int " Virtual Clients Number"
	default 1

	help
	  Number of virtual clients used for loading.

config CLIENTS_INITIAL_INC

	help
	  Specify the number of loading clients to be added each second till the 
            total clients number reaches the number, specified by CLIENTS_NUM.
            Zero number means, that use for loading all CLIENTS_NUM from the 
            very beginning, instead of gradual increase of clients number at loading 
            start.

config INTERFACE
	string " Network Interface for Loading"
	default "eth0"
	help
            Network interface used for loading. Run "ifconfig" or "ip addr" to

config IP_ADDR_MIN
	string " Minimal Address of the IP-Range for Loading"
	default "192.168.0.1"
	help
            To run loading you should choose a range of IP-addresses to be used
            by the virtual clients. Pass quad-dotted IPv4 string with the minimal 
            address here.

config IP_ADDR_MAX
	string " Maximum Address of the IP-Range for Loading"

config LOGIN_POST_STR
	string " Login POST String Matrix - see help"
	default "username=%s%d&password=%s%d"
          depends on LOGIN
	help
            To generate multiple unique users with unique passwords, use the string like
            "username=%s%d&password=%s%d". First '%s' will be substituted by the 
            value of LOGIN_USERNAME tag and '%d' by the client number. Second '%s' will
            be substituted by LOGIN_PASSWORD tag value and second '%d' by the same client
            number. For example, if LOGIN_USERNAME=robert, LOGIN_PASSWORD=stam
            and LOGIN_POST_STR "username=%s%d&password=%s%d", the final POST string, 
            used for the client number 1, will be  "username=robert1&password=stam1".
            In this case LOGIN_USERNAME and LOGIN_PASSWORD strings are used just 
            as base-words for generating unique user credentials by appending an number.
            To use the username and password 'as as', just provide LOGIN_POST_STR without 
            %d symbols, e.g. "user=%s&secret=%s". Thus, all clients will have the same
            POST credentials with the string looking like "user=robert&secret=stam".
