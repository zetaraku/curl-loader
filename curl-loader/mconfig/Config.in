            loading behavior. We recommend you to use unique names for your

config LOGIN_USERNAME
	string " Login Username"
	default ""
          depends on LOGIN
	help
            Username string

config LOGIN_PASSWORD
	string " Login Password"
	default ""
          depends on LOGIN

            Password string
comment "Login Password - support disabled"
	depends on !LOGIN

config LOGIN_REQ_TYPE
	string " Login Request Type"
	default "GET+POST"
          depends on LOGIN

config LOGIN_POST_STR
	string " Login POST String Matrix - see help"
	default "username=%s%d&password=%s%d"
          depends on LOGIN
	help
            To generate multiple unique users with unique passwords, use the string like
            "username=%s%d&password=%s%d". First '%s' will be substituted by the 
            value of LOGIN_USERNAME tag and '%d' by the client number. Second '%s' will
            be substituted by LOGIN_PASSWORD tag value and second '%d' by the same client
            number. For example, if LOGIN_USERNAME=robert, LOGIN_PASSWORD=stam
            and LOGIN_POST_STR "username=%s%d&password=%s%d", the final POST string, 
            used for the client number 1, will be  "username=robert1&password=stam1".
            In this case LOGIN_USERNAME and LOGIN_PASSWORD strings are used just 
            as base-words for generating unique user credentials by appending an number.
            To use the username and password 'as as', just provide LOGIN_POST_STR without 
            %d symbols, e.g. "user=%s&secret=%s". Thus, all clients will have the same
            POST credentials with the string looking like "user=robert&secret=stam".
