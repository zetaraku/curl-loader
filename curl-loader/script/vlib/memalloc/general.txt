
- allocate a big block when the allocator is initialsed?
    decided against it.
    allocate as you go - in any case it will be quite early in system
    startup, so no surprises here (if you wan't do be double sure then
    allocate something yourself)


- big blocks of the same size, or do we some sort of resize policy?
    i think fixed size for now; (???)
