1. HOWTO POST a text file, e.g. an XML-file.

Since the configuration with POST-ing URL and UPLOAD_FILE
is somehow buggy in libcurl and issues PUT instead of POST,
let's use the workaround as recommended by Alex.

Please, try the following:

1. Use the latest version of libcurl
2. Use FORM_USAGE_TYPE= AS_IS
3. FORM_STRING should be a single line, containing your XML file content 
without any newline symbols, because it is read as a single line by fgets.
The length is limited at 8K, by you can increase it at parse_conf.c by increasing the buffer size here:
char fgets_buff[1024*8];

4. An example configuration is below:

URL=http://192.168.2.56/nomadesk/index.phpTask?Navigator::Task=ReceiveMessage
URL_SHORT_NAME="Poll"
TIMER_URL_COMPLETION = 5000

TIMER_AFTER_URL_SLEEP = 5000
REQUEST_TYPE=POST
FORM_USAGE_TYPE= AS_IS
FORM_STRING=<Poll><Accounts><Account><AccountName>nmua000014</AccountName><Password>aventiv23</Password></Account></Accounts><LocationID>bf42425f-fcef-4ea3-aaab-199120138cb3</LocationID><ClientVersion>2.6.0.13</ClientVersion><CreationTstamp>10/28/2008 7:00:30 AM</CreationTstamp></Poll>
